## Remarks
+ good user interaction to modify the setup dynamically
+ missing html page and alone table handling
+ I think the must-haves features was not clear for you, ```The program can deal with the possibility of having to much people in the room.``` means you have to do something with them, not printing it :smile: But as you do it in the nice-to-have it's alright

## General remark
Good project guys!
