## Remarks
+ program did not ask me to add tables when trying with more persons, just printed: "NOT ENOUGH SEATS !"
+ good readme
+ you did not use file_utils to extract data from the file
+ display method really long but is it good work or chatgpt?
  

## General remark
Good typing, readme and constraints are observed. Code logic is good. Too bad the code does not handle more people but it's a good first project :fire:
